The purpose of this project is to understand the applicability of the architecture described on this [Uncle Bob talk](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years).

While the talk is very specific regarding the objective of architecture it is not completely clean regarding practical application.

* Looks like those ideas are closely related to [Robustness Diagrams](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/robustnessDiagram.htm)
* This 8th light post also looks helpful [The Clean Architecture](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

This is a work in progress and subject to our interpretation of the ideas.
